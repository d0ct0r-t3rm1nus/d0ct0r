Hello KMD Community!

I a KMD enthusiast in addition to being an experienced and self sufficient systems / networking administrator as well as an effective project planner, manager and service responder.

I Graduated college over 12 years ago now and I have been operating as an independent contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in sales, planning, coordinating, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, testing, servicing and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems.

I've never had a boss. Just a handful of regular, trusting, and happy clients. :)

I'm ready and very willing to make myself a part of the KMD network and community efforts by assisting newcomers where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience.
