Hello KMD Community!

I a KMD enthusiast in addition to being an experienced and self sufficient systems / networking administrator. I am also well versed in project planning, management and service responding.

I Graduated college over 12 years ago now and I have been operating as an independent contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in sales, planning, coordinating, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, testing, servicing, and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems.

I've never had a boss. Just a handful of regular, trusting, and happy clients. :)

I'm ready and very willing to make myself a part of the KMD network and community efforts. I joined the KMD discord channel within only days of it coming online. If elected I can be counted upon to remain present and involved with the Komodo community throughout my notary node upkeep and beyond. I'll work hard to keep my single node up and running at it's best in hopes of earning a second year of service.

I'm a true KMD believer and with your votes I'll earn a chance to prove this!


I am prepared to run 1 North American notary node to the best of my ability while also assisting community members where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience.
