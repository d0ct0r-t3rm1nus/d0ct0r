Hello KMD Community!

You should know, in addition to me being a massive KMD enthusiast I'm an experienced and self sufficient systems / networking administrator. I'm also well versed in project planning/management and service responding. I Graduated college over 12 years ago and I've been operating as an independent IT contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in medical imaging IT sales, planning, coordinating, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, testing, servicing, and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems. I've never had a boss. Just a handful of regular, trusting, and happy clients spanning the US.

The blockchain/crypto space has brought new depth to my passion for IT as well as new excitment/interest to every single day! GPU mining has been extremely fun, informative and almost profitable!!! :). I crafted a few custom rigs in summer of 2017 which I have successfully managed and improved upon since while achieving excellent uptime, power efficieny, and even heat utilization.

I'm ready and very willing to make myself a part of the KMD network and community efforts. I eagerly joined the KMD Discord channel within only days of it coming online. If elected I can be counted upon to remain present and involved with the Komodo community throughout my notary node upkeep and beyond. I'll work hard to keep my single node up and running at it's best in hopes of earning a second year of service!

I'm a true KMD believer and with enough votes I'll earn the chance to prove it.

I'm prepared to run 1 North American KMD Notary Node to the best of my ability while also assisting community members where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience.
