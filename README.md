Dear KMD Community,

I hope you are all doing well. I'm here because I'm a true KMD believer and with enough NN votes I'll earn the chance to prove it.

In addition to me being a massive KMD enthusiast I'm an experienced, self sufficient systems / networking administrator and project planner / manager as well as continued service directing / responding. I graduated college over 12 years ago and I've been operating as an independent IT contractor ever since. I've spent this time specializing in medical imaging IT sales, planning, coordinating, installing, configuring, calibrating, networking, securing, testing, servicing, and troubleshooting HIPPA compliant systems. I've never had a boss. Just a handful of regular, trusting, and happy clients spanning the US.

The blockchain / crypto space has brought new depth and passion to my already obsessive IT life. Once more I'm invigoratied, interested and excited to greet my professional life every morning, every day. Thank you crypto space!

Custom rig building / GPU mining has been extremely fun! The experience has been beyond informative. Eye opening, highly thought provoking, and surprisingly a bit character building. I crafted a few systems in summer of 2017 ~ 20 GPU's - which I have successfully managed, maintained, upgraded and continually improved upon since. Through persistence I've achieved exceptional / competitive hashrate, excellent uptime, power efficieny, and effective heat utilization. All this whille constantly reassessing value. Not just conceptualizing but actually fully realizing trade-off value for the first time...

I'm ready and very willing to make myself a part of the KMD network / community efforts. I eagerly joined the KMD Discord channel within only days of it coming online. If elected I can be counted upon to remain present and involved with the Komodo community throughout my notary node upkeep and beyond. I'll work hard to keep my single node up and running at it's best in hopes of earning a second year of service!

I'm prepared to run 1 North American KMD Notary Node to the best of my ability while also assisting community members where and when possible across a full range of potential matters which I might contribute advice towards drawn from years of real world experience.
